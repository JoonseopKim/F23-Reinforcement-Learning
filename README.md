## Introduction  

Reinforcement learning gives ChatGPT its human-like feel, lets AlphaZero beat chess grandmasters, and empowers robots to teach themselves how to walk.

RL stands as a fundamental pillar of artificial intelligence, empowering AI agents to discern optimal decisions by learning from their interactions within a dynamic environment. 
Much like honing a skill through trial and error, RL enables AI to evolve continuously, mastering tasks and achieving heightened proficiency over time.

The most magical part is that you can use human intelligence to refine behavior, and human intelligence alone.  

## Description
This project consists of two major parts. Initially, we will place heavy emphasis on learning about deep reinforcement learning. Then, once we understand the basics, we will create synthetic reward signals from human preferences using supervised machine learning, so that we can train agents to perform tasks free from the constraints of pre-defined reward signals.

We will use the gymnasium python package to interact with environments and will create our own algorithms to train the agent from both pre-defined reward signals and human feedback.

## Goals  

- Introduce participants to the fundamental concepts, terminology, and principles of reinforcement learning, cultivating a strong grasp of the field's underlying mechanics.
- Provide participants with practical exposure to industry-standard tools such as Python, PyTorch, and NumPy.
- Challenge participants to implement essential reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Guide members through the intricate process of incorporating human feedback a synthetic reward mechanism that aligns AI agents' behavior with human preferences.
- Share results and visualize trained agents.
- Have fun and learn something :)
